Hello to Airbnb,
I'm 90%(1 week left) completed with a web development bootcamp on udemy.com, didn't want to pass up the opportunity apply at a well known tech company so I put together a simple crud app while still learning.
I hope you consider me as an applicant, I am excited to acquire new skills that apply to tech, and solve problems that could benefit users.
I look forward to working with your engineering team and being mentored in hopes to become a full fledged software engineer under your guidance and supervision!
